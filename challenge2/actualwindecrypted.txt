So you've figured it out. Yay! The next one can be found at www.              carsonholgate.com/afine.
 419 Your hints for the next round: this one is an afine cipher and it will        be encoded ASCII. Keep checking back at the page for the second               challenge, if I decide that it's too evil I will release more                 information.
 420 If you want to be added to the leader board email me at:                      FreeThinkersPulpit@gmail.com with the code word I used for encoding           challenge two (easy or hard) as the subject line and tell me somewhere        in the body what you want to be called.
